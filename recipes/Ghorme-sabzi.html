    <h2>About Ghorme Sabzi</h2>

Ghorme Sabzi is one of the most iconic and beloved dishes in Iranian cuisine. Known for its rich aroma and deep green color, it is a stew made with fresh herbs, red kidney beans, and tender meat — usually lamb or beef. Its flavor is deepened with dried limes (limoo amani), giving it a tangy, slightly sour profile that’s uniquely Persian.
