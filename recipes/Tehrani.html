<p>
The Tehrani version of Ghorme Sabzi is perhaps the most widely known and cooked style across Iran. It emphasizes a rich, balanced flavor with slightly more dried lime for a deeper tangy touch. This version is usually slow-cooked and served with Persian steamed rice (chelo).

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare the herbs:</strong> Finely chop fresh parsley, coriander, and chives or leeks. Dry them slightly if needed, then sauté them in a bit of oil until dark green and aromatic.</li>
  <li><strong>Sauté the onion:</strong> In a separate large pot, fry finely chopped onion until golden. Add turmeric and stir well.</li>
  <li><strong>Add meat:</strong> Add lamb or beef cubes to the onion and brown them on all sides.</li>
  <li><strong>Mix herbs and beans:</strong> Add the sautéed herbs to the pot along with soaked kidney beans. Stir gently.</li>
  <li><strong>Add water:</strong> Pour in enough water to cover the mixture. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.</li>
  <li><strong>Add dried limes:</strong> Pierce 2–3 dried limes with a fork and drop them into the stew. This is key to the Tehrani flavor.</li>
  <li><strong>Simmer gently:</strong> Cover and cook on low heat for 2–3 hours until the meat is tender and the flavors have combined deeply.</li>
  <li><strong>Final touch:</strong> Season with salt, pepper, and a touch of lemon juice if desired.</li>
</ol>

Tehrani Ghorme Sabzi is known for its patience and depth — it’s not rushed, and that’s why it’s unforgettable. It's traditionally served with buttery saffron rice, and sometimes with a side of raw onions or torshi (pickled vegetables).
