<p>
In the lush, green regions of Northern Iran, Ghorme Sabzi takes on a slightly different character. This version is more herbal, sometimes includes local greens, and may even be cooked with a hint of garlic or sour pomegranate paste for extra flavor depth. It's a vibrant, soulful variation that reflects the natural richness of the north.

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Use local herbs:</strong> In addition to parsley, coriander, and leeks, northern families often include wild herbs like “khalvash” or “anari” (if available), or substitute with mint and spinach.</li>
  <li><strong>Add garlic:</strong> After frying the onion, add 3–4 cloves of minced garlic to bring a deeper aroma.</li>
  <li><strong>Cook the beans and meat as usual:</strong> Lamb or beef is browned with turmeric, then mixed with sautéed herbs and kidney beans.</li>
  <li><strong>Optional: Add pomegranate paste:</strong> For a regional twist, 1 tablespoon of **paste (rob-e-anar)** can be stirred in along with the dried limes to add a sour layer.</li>
  <li><strong>Simmer slowly:</strong> Let the stew cook gently for 2–3 hours. The aroma of garlic, herbs, and limoo amani makes this version feel homely and fresh.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This Northern variation is perfect for those who love complex herbal notes and a slight tanginess in their stew. Best enjoyed with steamed Persian rice, fresh herbs, or pickled garlic.
